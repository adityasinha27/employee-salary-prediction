## 📊 Features

- Predicts **annual salary** using a **Random Forest Regressor**
- Interactive **Streamlit UI**
- Live **data input via sidebar**
- Clean dashboard with:
  - Metric cards for user summary
  - Salary prediction bar chart
- ⚙️ Model trained on a real-world salary dataset
- 🧠 ML evaluation & comparison of 8+ models (code included)
